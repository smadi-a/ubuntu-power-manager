# Ubuntu Power Manager

### A tiny script to configure an Ubuntu powered laptop to do things like dim the screen's backlight when the power source is disconnected.

### To install:
```
./setup.sh
```

#### The defualt backlight values for when connected and disconnected from a powersource are 100 and 60, respectively. To change that, once the installation is done, edit `/usr/local/bin/power_events`
